   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>Sometimes called banana cream pudding. Consists of layers of sweet vanilla flavoured custard, vanilla wafers and sliced fresh bananas. Topped with whipped cream and meringue.</p>
   <p>Commonly associated with Southern US cuisine.</p>

   <h3>Description</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup flour</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>6 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>6 egg yolks</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup butter</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>9 ripe bananas</li>
    <li>2 (12 ounce) boxes vanilla wafers</li>
    <li>6 egg whites</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Stir together 1 cup sugar, the flour, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in milk, egg yolks, and whole eggs until well combined and smooth.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour milk mixture into saucepan with butter; reduce heat to medium-low and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened, coats the back of a spoon nicely, and begins to bubble, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla. Cover and let custard cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. (It will continue to thicken as it cools.)</li>
    <li>Peel and slice bananas. Line the bottom and sides of 2 (9x13-inch) broiler-safe casserole dishes with vanilla wafers. Layer banana slices over wafers. Pour cooled custard over bananas and wafers, smoothing top with a knife or spatula.</li>
    <li>For meringue, in a large clean bowl, using an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla at high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Spoon meringue over top of custard, covering it completely.</li>
    <li>Set oven rack about 4 inches from broiler; turn broiler to high. Quickly broil meringues until browned, about 1 to 2 minutes. (This happens very quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)</li>
    <li>Remove dishes from oven, allow meringue to cool slightly, about 15 minutes, and serve. (Chill, covered, up to 4 days.)</li>
   </ol>
